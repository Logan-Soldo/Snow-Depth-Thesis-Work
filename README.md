# SnowDepth
Thesis work for Snow Depth Climatology over Central North America from 1966-2018.
  The study covers snow depth from the pan-handle of Texas in the south, to as far north as Alberta Canada. 
  The lateral bounds are east of the Rocky Mountains to the Great Lakes.
The repository is split into sections based on the language used (i.e. Fortran90, Bash, or Python).
Note that Python is not a part of the master branch as it is only used for figure creation and additional statistics.
